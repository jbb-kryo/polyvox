Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including:

- GitHub repository (issues, pull requests, discussions)
- Project documentation
- Official communication channels
- Community events and meetups
- Any space where someone is representing the project

This Code of Conduct also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

### Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainers responsible for enforcement through GitHub Issues or direct messages to maintainers.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All project maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
